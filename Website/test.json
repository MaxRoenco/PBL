It utilizes tags enclosed in angle brackets to define elements within a document.\n\n## Understanding Tags and Elements\nTags are the building blocks of HTML, representing elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Each tag serves a specific purpose in formatting and organizing content.\n\n## Basic HTML Document Structure\nA typical HTML document starts with a document type declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`), followed by an HTML element (`<html>`), which contains the document's structure within `<head>` and `<body>` sections.",
